Ultrasonic sensors are great tools for measuring distance and detecting objects without actual contact with the physical world. 
It is used in several applications, like measuring liquid levels and checking proximity, and it is even more prevalent in automobiles to assist in self-parking or anti-collision systems.
In this project, we have used the HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor with Arduino to determine the distance of an obstacle from the sensor. The basic principle of ultrasonic distance measurement is based on ECHO. When sound waves are transmitted in the environment, they return to their origin as ECHO after striking the obstacle. So, we only need to calculate the traveling time of both sounds, which means outgoing time and returning time to origin after striking the obstacle. As the speed of the sound is known to us, we can calculate the distance after some calculation. We have used this same technique for this Arduino distance measurement project.
